    Welcome!

<p>
    <strong>The GDPR setup wizard will guide you through the legal and technical requirements for your site.</strong><br>
    <br>
    We have made this process as easy, fast and painless as possible for you. <br>
    However, you should take some time to read and understand everything. Making your website (and business) properly compliant
    requires understanding GDPR and how your website works. <br>
    If you don't have the time to do that, you can always <a href="<?= gdpr('helpers')->docs('wordpress-gdpr-consultation'); ?>" target="_blank">request a consultation</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="<?= gdpr('helpers')->docs('wordpress-site-owners-guide-to-gdpr/'); ?>" target="_blank">WordPress Site Owner's Guide to GDPR</a> will help you with any questions you might have during the
    setup process.
